My name is Yamian Cortes (@selfdotdev) and I launched my self-teaching programming journey in 2024.
I want to become a proficient Web Developer so that I can work as front end engineer or back end.
Another coding or computer-related field I am interested in is Game Development. I love video games.
I want to create applications that can offer versatility in simplicity.
I am a fast learner and passionate of my efforts.
